### Company Description (200 words max)
```
Elysium Wealth Evolution Limited (Company No. 803816, Dublin, Ireland) is a dual-regulated fintech company licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland (fund administrator) and BVI (fund manager). We operate POD Labs, a revolutionary on-chain fund platform that enables emerging fund managers to launch in days (not months) at a fraction of traditional costs ($5-20K vs $50-200K).

Our platform (technology partner Bankelysium) develops and operates proprietary trading and market-analysis infrastructure. It processes 5.6TB+ of multi-chain DeFi data across 6 blockchain networks and 10+ DeFi protocols for signal generation, execution optimisation, and AI-driven analytics. ML models power quarterly training and daily inference on Google Cloud Platform.

Infrastructure: 14 microservices deployed as Cloud Run Jobs, GCS data lake with lifecycle policies, Artifact Registry for 5 shared Python libraries, Secret Manager for 50+ API keys. All workloads are AI/ML-intensive (feature engineering, model training, inference).

We've raised €2M in institutional funding and currently support 5 fund managers managing $10M AUM. Target: Scale to 50+ fund managers managing $500M+ AUM within 2 years using Google Cloud credits.

## 3. Product/Service Description

### Primary Industry Focus
```
FinTech / Financial Services / AI/ML
```

### What problem are you solving? (300 words max)
```
Legacy fund infrastructure is expensive ($50-200K setup), slow (months to launch), error-prone (manual processes), and offers terrible UX (paper-based onboarding). This prevents emerging managers from launching funds and limits investor access to alternative investment strategies. The result: fragmented tools, zero interoperability, quarterly dealings, and delayed settlements that take days to weeks.

POD Labs solves this with an on-chain fund ledger, enabling days to launch ($5-20K setup), same-day investor onboarding, daily NAVs, and instant settlement. Our platform is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (fund administrator) and BVI (fund manager), providing institutional credibility while modernizing the entire capital formation process.

However, the critical differentiator is AI-driven signal generation and analytics. Our platform (Bankelysium technology) processes multi-chain DeFi data (AAVE, Morpho, Uniswap, Lido) across 6 blockchain networks to generate ML-powered signals and execution optimisation. Fund managers use the infrastructure for their strategies; custody and client-facing operations are handled by regulated counterparties (POD Labs, custodians). Client exposure is limited to research, signals, or segregated mandates.

Impact: Democratizing access to alternative investments. Every fund manager we onboard creates jobs, generates returns for investors, and expands the investable universe. With Google Cloud credits, we can scale from 5 → 50+ fund managers and $10M → $500M+ AUM, enabling thousands of investors to access AI-driven strategies that were previously available only to institutional players.
```

### What makes you unique? (Differentiation)
```
1. Dual-regulated: CBI (Ireland) + BVI fund manager licenses = credibility + compliance
2. Production-ready: 14 services deployed, 5.6TB processed, 35%+ test coverage, quality gates enforced
3. Multi-chain DeFi: 6 blockchains, 10+ protocols, real-time onchain data processing
4. AI-driven signals & analytics: ML models trained on multi-asset data (DeFi, CeFi, TradFi) for signal generation and execution optimisation
5. Ecosystem play: POD connects managers, allocators, custodians, investors - infrastructure scales with platform
6. Proven traction: €2M raised, 5 fund managers, $10M AUM, 140+ venue connectivity
